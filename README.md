# The Complete *p*-Center Problem  
## Contents  
This repository contains various codes for solving the complete *p*-center problem using Gurobi with Python and Numba when doing brute-force enumeration. There are also less up-to-date codes for Xpress Optimizer and Google OR-Tools, but we strongly recommend using the Gurobi codes as they are the most up-to-date. The 55-point Swain and TSP library data sets are also included.  
  
**Requirements**  
[Gurobi](https://www.gurobi.com/): last tested with v8.1.1  
[Numba](https://numba.pydata.org/): last tested with v0.42.1  
[Google OR-Tools](https://developers.google.com/optimization/): last tested with v5.0  
[Fico Xpress](https://www.fico.com/en/products/fico-xpress-optimization): last tested with v7.8  
Gurobi tested with Python 3.7.4  
OR-Tools originally developted with Python 2, should be mostly converted to Python 3 now.
